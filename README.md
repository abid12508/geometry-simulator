Simulate your shapes by plugging in your values. Once you press the enter button, a new window will open and the turtle will make your logged shape.
You can also enter the amount of loops you want to have. Have fun! FYI if you need to run the exe, make sure to download it onto your github folder.
I had to add the exact path of the icon. (C:\GitHub\geometry-simulator)
