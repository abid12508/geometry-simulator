# geometry-simulator
Simulate your shapes by plugging in your values. Once you press the enter button, a new window will open and the turtle will make your logged shape.
You can also enter the amount of loops you want to have. Have fun! FYI if you need to run the exe, make sure to download it onto your github folder.
I had to add the exact path of the icon (C:\GitHub\geometry-simulator).

# Square
The first tab will feature a square shape simulator. Using turtle graphics, your four values (2 x, 2 y) will determine the size of your square. \
the image below is a model of the square.

```
forward(300) # of pixels
left(90) 90 degrees
```

There will also be a loop system that will track the amount of loops for your square. 

```
    def func():
        loops = 0
        while loops < amount of loops client wanted.get():
          {code}
          loops += 1
```
